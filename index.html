            <h2>The Art of Boredom...</h2>

            <p>In today's world, doing nothing almost seems like one of the biggest mistakes you can make. We're constantly stimulated with something peaking our interest; scrolling through social media, watching the newest movie, reacting to our friends post. We're constantly going going going and we never give ourselves the chance to relax and recharge. We fear being left out of the know or missing something important. We don't want our best friend to post without being one of the first ones to see it. Just right now you might be wondering if you're missing something! However, what if what the world really needs is more boredom.</p>
            <p>Scientists have found that some of our greatest ideas have come from us just sitting around and even lead to an increase in brain fucntion (figure 1). The calm mind sparks bright ideas! When these ideas poor out of us, we are able to solve problems work out scenarios, and investigate the enviornment around us. However, when our minds are constantly at work, they struggle to keep up with the little things.</p>

                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Doing nothing doesn't always mean you are being super lazy...maybe some of the time. Instead, it means it's time to give that hard working brain some time to rest and recharge. Look out the window, go on a short walk, sit down and close your eyes. Anything you can do to relax and let your thoughts roam is going to be better for you in the long run.</p>

            <h2>The Power of Ordinary!</h2>
            <p><time datetime="2025-09-25T17:14:00">9/25/2025 5:14PM</time></p>

            <p>In a world where we are constantly chasing perfection, it's hard to just accept the Ordinary. Every post we see on social media we try to replicate, we try to be the perfectionists we see online. This might come down to always needing the latest fashion brands, needing to style your hair a certain way that is the new hit, or changing who you are just to fit in.</p>
            <p>Enjoying your life doesn't mean everything needs to be perfect, you don't even have to pretend. Life isn't just about the glim and glammer or about always being in the spotlight. It's about you being you and doing what you want to do, not what others make you think is important. You don't need to look fancy to be fancy. You don't need your favorite song to be the most popular for it to be your favorite. Every aspect of your life is worth your attention and respect, it's your life afterall.</p>
            <p>Respecting the ordinary teaches us how to enjoy the little things in life. It teaches us to slow down, ignore those around us, and focus on what makes us happy, not what will make others happy. Joy doesn't have to be hard to attain, even the small things can bring great joy. Remember, it's ok to be ordinary!</p>
