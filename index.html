            <p>In today's world, doing nothing almost seems like one of the biggest mistakes you can make. We're constantly stimulated with something peaking our interest; scrolling through social media, watching the newest movie, reacting to our friends post. We're constantly going going going and we never give ourselves the chance to relax and recharge. We fear being left out of the know or missing something important. We don't want our best friend to post without being one of the first ones to see it. Just right now you might be wondering if you're missing something! However, what if what the world really needs is more boredom.</p>
            <p>Scientists have found that some of our greatest ideas have come from us just sitting around. The calm mind sparks bright ideas! When these ideas poor out of us, we are able to solve problems work out scenarios, and investigate the enviornment around us. However, when our minds are constantly at work, they struggle to keep up with the little things.</p>
            <p>Doing nothing doesn't always mean you are being super lazy...maybe some of the time. Instead, it means it's time to give that hard working brain some time to rest and recharge. Look out the window, go on a short walk, sit down and close your eyes. Anything you can do to relax and let your thoughts roam is going to be better for you in the long run.</p>
