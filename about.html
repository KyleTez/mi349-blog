            <h3>Growing Up</h3>
                <p class="aboutcontent">Hello, my name is Kyle Teszlewicz! I am 21 years-old, grew up in Lansing Michigan with my parents and 1 sister, and currently attend Michigan State University. I went to high school at Dewitt High School graduating in the class of 2022.</p>
                <p id="picp"><img id="aboutpic" src="IMG_1599.jpeg" alt="Growing Up Pictre">The picture to the right is a quick shot of me this past summer. My girlfriends family and I took a week long vacation to Branson, Missouri. This picture is taken just before sunset right outside of the airbnb we were staying at!</p>
            <h3>Spare Time</h3>
                 <p class="aboutcontent">Growing up and still currently, I loved to do the following things-</p>
            <ul id="funthings">
                <li>Playing Video Games!</li>
                <li>Riding My Bike!</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Work</h3>
                <p class="aboutcontent">My first job ever was a dishwasher at a local bar that was own by one of my good friends paretns. I worked there for around 2 years but decided it wouldn't really work out as I was going into college. Since then, I have worked at the Michigan Department of Attorney General as an IT student. This job opportunity has been a true blessing in my life and I will forever be grateful for the amount of skills and lessons I have learned throughout my time working with this department.</p>
            <h3>College</h3>
                <p class="aboutcontent">I originally started my journey through college at Lansing Community College in 2022. I attended college there for 2 years before transferring to Michigan State Univsersity in the Fall of 2024 with a major in Supply Chain Management. After 1 semester I found out that this major wasn't quite for me and changed majors to Information Science with a focus in Media and Information.</p>
            <h3>Future</h3>
                <p class="aboutcontent">I plan to graduate college following the Spring 2026 semester. I will then move to Illinois to live with my girlfriend as she wraps up her last year of college next year. In the future I would love to possibly still work in some kind of government work or sustainbale IT work.</p>
